# [Michael Cui's Portfolio](https://mcui1997.github.io/Portfolio/)

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Michael Cui and I am a Full Stack Developer with a biomedical/software engineering background. I love developing beautiful web and mobile applications and enjoy the freedom of coding. Learning programming is similar to learning a new language, but the possbilities and usages of this particular language are limitless. To be a programmer is to devote yourself to a lifetime of learning and I truly enjoy every second of it!

This portfolio showcases some of my major and recent projects but please feel free to check out more projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/MCui1997).
